   - Temporary context for current task
   - In-memory caching of frequently accessed data

2. **Long-term Memory**
   - User preferences and patterns
   - Historical email interactions
   - Learned responses and solutions
   - User-specific email management strategies
   - Persistent storage in PostgreSQL/Supabase

3. **Memory Types**
   - **Episodic Memory**: Specific email interactions and their outcomes
   - **Semantic Memory**: Learned patterns and general knowledge
   - **Procedural Memory**: Email management strategies and workflows
   - **Working Memory**: Current task context and temporary information

4. **Memory Operations**
   - Memory consolidation from short-term to long-term
   - Memory retrieval based on context
   - Memory pruning for irrelevant information
   - Memory indexing for quick access
   - Memory summarization for efficient storage

5. **Memory Integration**
   - Integration with LangChain's memory components
